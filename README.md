# MindOfAction-Combat

This game is based on MultiPlayer gaming, whose focus is PVP with certain but minor degree of PVE, and whose combat mechanism is based on switching weapons and shooting using different weapons to achieve a dynamic as well as strategic combat environment.

  (Note: As it’s a PVP game, we, the developers expect the players to be civilized and down to earth to each other and not to violate the rule of engagement).
  
  By completing each Level of the game, Players will earn a certain weapons and points. As it will be an online based IP game there will be an option for guest users. Moreover, people of different countries can play this game by joining any group or any close IP domain.

By completing each Level of the game, Players will earn a certain weapons and points. As it will be an online based IP game there will be an option for guest users. Moreover, people of different countries can play this game by joining any group or any close IP domain. This game will focus on new maps, excotic weapons, awesome visual effects. As per described in the last paragraph, this game will be online based and people can make their own group, or they can arrange a level of game among them. So that this game design will be pretty simple like different cities or any other area with few buildings and structure for shelter and firing. As my game main focus is earning a certain level of skill. So if players play in a team still they have to work from their level in a same play field like more skill users might use sniper rifle or shotgun. As there are lots of action games in the market, This fast-paced Casual game allows
instant respawns and encourages rapid engagements. After spawning, players have a limited amount of time to select weapons of their choice and engage the enemy. throughout the match players will be given bonus points for achieving kills. Respawn immediately and get back to the fight! Each player can equip 4 weapons at the same time with the ability to change which types of weapons they want to equip when they are in a safe environment. Players can hold 2 one-handed weapons or 1 two-handed weapon at any given time, and switch among the 4 weapons that are currently equipped.

          This game can be built by using some template from Unity assets store. All objects and equipment can be imported from a few sources.

      Game Genre: Multiplayer FPS Game

# Plan :
1. We are developing a FPS game with an environment as an initial start. We
develop a game with few AI enemies for now. We are working on
implementing a few ammunition, especially guns and hand grenades. For
testing each works with a set few default AI enemies.
2. We set a basic environment using probuilt (a building) but we are looking for
a big environment where we can do all our basic functionality.

# Project Management: (Extreme Programming (XP))
eXtreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to
improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

      Basic principles will be followed :
      1. Coding
      2. Testing
      3. Listening
      4. Designing
      5. Feedback
      6. Simplicity

Testing Strategy: (AirTest Platform) The testing of our game will strictly follow the
development state. 

Tests will be carried out after the addition or completion of each component and functionality. We will be using the AirTest Platform to design and execute our tests.

User Interface:

 The user interface must be adaptive to fit many sizes of screens, and the UI elements must reflect the changes in character stats effects.

1. Window resizing - we will use Airtest to automate window resizing on the game
client. The game passes the test if all the UI elements are correctly placed and sized
on the screen when screen resolution is between 800*640 and 3240*2160.

2. Responsiveness - we will automate a series of attacks and special effects on a player
character (the character will be healed to full HP after HP reaches 1) and observe the
UI responding to these actions. AirTest will gradually increase the speed with which
these actions are carried out and the system passes the test if all the registered actions
are reflected on the UI when APM is under 500.
